In the terminal, you will most likely see this output as well:

```text
 Failed to instantiate: 
weka.gui.beans.Loader
```
This behavior can happen under Gnome with Java 5/6, see [GUIChooser starts but not Experimenter or Explorer](gui_chooser_starts_but_not_experimenter_or_explorer.md) for a solution. Encountered in [this Weka list post](https://list.scms.waikato.ac.nz/mailman/htdig/wekalist/2006-june/007386.html).
