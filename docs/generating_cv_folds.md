You have two choices of generating cross-validation folds:

* [Filter approach](generating_cv_folds_filter.md) - uses a [bash](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash) script to generate the train/test pairs beforehand
* [Java approach](generating_cv_folds_java.md) - to be used from within your own Java code, creates train/test pairs on the fly
