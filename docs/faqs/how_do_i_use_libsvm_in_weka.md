If you run the classifier `weka.classifiers.functions.LibSVM` and get the *libsvm classes not in CLASSPATH!* error message, you are missing the libsvm jar archive in your current classpath. The `LibSVM` classifier is only a wrapper and doesn't need the libsvm classes to compile (uses Reflection). Check out the [LibSVM](../lib_svm.md) article for details about how to use this classifier.
