Weka 3.7.3 has a new package that provides an environment for time series analysis. The article [How do I use the package manager?](../packages/manager.md) can be followed to install this package. Once installed, the package provides a plugin tab in the Explorer. Documentation on the time series environment can be found [here](http://wiki.pentaho.com/display/DATAMINING/Time+Series+Analysis+and+Forecasting+with+Weka) 

Older versions of Weka have limited support for time series analysis and consists of only two filters, [TimeSeriesDelta](https://weka.sourceforge.io/doc.dev/weka/filters/unsupervised/attribute/TimeSeriesDelta.html) and [TimeSeriesTranslate](https://weka.sourceforge.io/doc.dev/weka/filters/unsupervised/attribute/TimeSeriesTranslate.html). There are modified (not supported by the University of Waikato) versions of WEKA out there, that offer additional functionality ([1](http://davis.wpi.edu/xmdv/weka/), [2](http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~waleed/tclass/)).
