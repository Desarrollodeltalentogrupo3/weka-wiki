WEKA's default setup for databases tries to locate some common [JDBC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jdbc) driver classes ("JDBC" is the Java way of connecting to databases, like MySQL, HSQLDB, etc.) at startup time. By just adding these JDBC drivers to your [CLASSPATH](../classpath.md), WEKA will be automatically able to connect to these databases. If you are not trying to access a database, just forget about these messages. Otherwise, check out the [databases](../databases.md) article for more information (the database type that you are trying to connect to might not be listed by default).
