To run the Windows installer for WEKA without in "silent" mode (i.e. without any graphical prompts/dialogs):

* Open a command prompt window
* Navigate to the directory where the installer executable resides
* Type .\weka-x-y-z.exe /S

Replace x, y and z with the correct version numbers for your installer of course. Note that the /S is a capital S.
