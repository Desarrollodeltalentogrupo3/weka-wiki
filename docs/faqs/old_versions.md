# Where can I get old versions of WEKA?
If you need a specific version of WEKA, e.g., due to some third-party tools, go [WEKA's project page](http://sourceforge.net/projects/weka/) on [Sourceforge.net](http://sourceforge.net/). In the [Files section](https://sourceforge.net/projects/weka/files/) you have access to all the releases ever made.
