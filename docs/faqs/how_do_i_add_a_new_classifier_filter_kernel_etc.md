As of WEKA 3.4.4, all the derived classes of superclasses that can be edited in the GenericObjectEditor, like subclasses of `weka.classifiers.Classifier` for instance, can be determined dynamically at runtime. Read [here](../genericobjecteditor.md) for more information.

**Note:** WEKA 3.5.8 and 3.6.0 turned the automatic discovery *off* by default. Starting with 3.6.1 and 3.7.0 it is turned *on* again.
