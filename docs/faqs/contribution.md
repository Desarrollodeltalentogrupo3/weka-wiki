Information on how to contribute to WEKA can be found in the [Contributing a package](../packages/structure.md#contributing-a-package) section of the [How are packages structured for the package management system?](../packages/structure.md) article. The conditions for new classifiers (schemes in general) are that, firstly, they have to be published in the proceedings of a renowned conference (e.g., ICML) or as an article of respected journal (e.g., Machine Learning) and, secondly, that they outperform other standard schemes (e.g., J48/C4.5).

But please bear in mind, that we don't have a lot of man power, i.e., being the WEKA maintainer is **NOT** a full-time position.
