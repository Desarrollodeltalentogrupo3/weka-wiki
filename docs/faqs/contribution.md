# How can I contribute to WEKA?

Information on how to contribute to WEKA can be found in the [[How are packages structured for the package management system?#Contributing|Contributing a package]] section of the [[How are packages structured for the package management system?]] article. The conditions for new classifiers (schemes in general) are that, firstly, they have to be published in the proceedings of a renowned conference (e.g., ICML) or as an article of respected journal (e.g., Machine Learning) and, secondly, that they outperform other standard schemes (e.g., J48/C4.5).

But please bear in mind, that we don't have a lot of man power, i.e., being the WEKA maintainer is **NOT** a full-time position.
