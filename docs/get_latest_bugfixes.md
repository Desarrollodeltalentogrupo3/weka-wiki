Weka is actively developed, that means that bugs are fixed and new functionality is added (only to the developer version) all the time. Every now and then (about every 6-12 months), when there was a sufficiently large number of improvements or fixes, a release is made and uploaded to [Sourceforget.net](http://sourceforge.net/projects/weka/).

If you don't want to wait that long, you have two options:

1. Get the latest source code from **Subversion** and compile it yourself. See the following articles for more information

    1. [obtaining the source code from Subversion](subversion.md), either book or developer version
    2. [compiling the source code](compiling_weka.md)

2. Download a **snapshot** from the download section of the [Weka homepage](http://cs.waikato.ac.nz/~ml/weka/). Snapshots for book and developer version are generated automatically every night, based on the current Subversion code. The [ZIP files](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZIP_%28file_format%29) have the same content as a release, i.e., compiled classes (= weka.jar), source code (= weka-src.jar), Javadoc and other documentation.

  ***Note:*** compare the timestamp of the [Weka Mailing List](mailing_list.md) post that reports a bugfix with the one of the snapshot to make sure the bugfix is already included in the snapshot.
