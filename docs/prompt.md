[PROMPT](http://webclu.bio.wzw.tum.de/prompt/) is a open source platform independent system for retrieval, analysis, mapping and comparison of protein sets. PROMPT's focus lies on statistical testing; Data in WEKA's [ARFF](arff.md) format can be imported and other data formats can be exported to WEKA. It thus complements the machine learning techniques of the WEKA workbench with statistical significance tests.
