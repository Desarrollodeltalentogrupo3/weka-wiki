I am looking for input from WEKA users. Please leave a comment on the website and I'll respond back. The input/help I need from WEKA users is as follows:


* I need to know what algorithms would be desired to have optimized first. For now, I'm working on Bayes (for starters).
* I need willing volunteers to use the revised code that I create (I am not making any changes to the algorithms just diverting the mathematical calculations from the CPU to the GPU to increase speed) and let me know of any performance changes observed.
