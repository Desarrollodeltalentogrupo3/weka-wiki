Apart from the Wiki and the other standard sources of information
about Weka, such as the manual, there is a lot of other relevant
information available in books and online. This page has been filled
mostly thanks to answers on the
[wekalist](https://list.waikato.ac.nz/postorius/lists/wekalist.list.waikato.ac.nz/).

# Important Tips

* Since many people use Weka, lots of (basic & advanced) questions have already been asked on the mailing list. Therefore, using "<your request> wekalist" in your preferred search engine might help you get an answer faster than asking the same question again on the list **before** doing any research on your own first.
* In case you would be **really lazy**: [http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=<mysearch>%20wekalist](http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=<mysearch>%20wekalist)

# Weka-based development 

* Code Examples
    * A Simple Text Classifier in Java with WEKA presents and discuses two little programs as examples of how to integrate WEKA into your Java code for text mining: <http://jmgomezhidalgo.blogspot.com.es/2013/04/a-simple-text-classifier-in-java-with.html>
	* Language Identification as Text Classification with WEKA explains how to build an automated language guesser for texts as a complete example of a text mining process with WEKA, and in order to demonstrate a more advanced usage of the StringToWordVector class: <http://jmgomezhidalgo.blogspot.com.es/2013/05/language-identification-as-text.html>
    * Sample Code for Text Indexing with WEKA shows how to index a text dataset using your own Java code and the StringToWordVector filter in WEKA: <http://jmgomezhidalgo.blogspot.com.es/2013/06/sample-code-for-text-indexing-with-weka.html>
