The following matrix shows which minimum version of Java is necessary
to run a specific Weka version. The latest official releases of Weka
require Java 8 or later.

Note that if you are using Windows and your computer has a display
with high pixel density (HiDPI), you may need to use Java 9 or later to avoid
problems with inappropriate scaling of Weka's graphical user interfaces.
