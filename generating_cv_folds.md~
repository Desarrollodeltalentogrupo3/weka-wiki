You have two choices of generating cross-validation folds:
* [[Generating cross-validation folds (Filter approach)|Filter approach]] - uses a [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash|bash]] script to generate the train/test pairs beforehand
* [[Generating cross-validation folds (Java approach)|Java approach]] - to be used from within your own Java code, creates train/test pairs on the fly
