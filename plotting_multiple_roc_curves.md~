== Description ==
Comparing different classifiers on one dataset can also be done via [[ROC curves]], not just via Accuracy, Correlation coefficient etc. In the **Explorer** it is **not** possible to do that for several classifiers, this is only possible in the **KnowledgeFlow**.

This is the basic setup (based on [[https://list.scms.waikato.ac.nz/mailman/htdig/wekalist/2005-May/003989.html|this]] Wekalist post):

 ---dataSet---> ClassAssigner 
 ---dataSet---> ClassValuePicker              (the class label you want the plot for)
 ---dataSet---> CrossValidationFoldMaker 
 ---trainingSet/testSet (i.e. BOTH connections)---> Classifier of your choice 
 ---batchClassifier---> ClassifierPerformanceEvaluator 
 ---thresholdData---> ModelPerformanceChart

This setup can be easily extended to host several classifiers, which illustrates the [[file:Plotting_multiple_roc.kfml]] example, containing {{J48}} and {{RandomForest}} as classifiers.

== Description ==
The [[file:VisualizeMultipleROC.java]] class lets you display several ROC curves in a single plot. The data it is using for display is from previously saved ROC curves. This example class is just a modified version of the [[file:VisualizeROC.java]] class, which displays only a single ROC curve (see [[Visualizing ROC curve]] article).
