= ARFF file doesn't load =
One way to figure out why **[[ARFF]] files are failing to load** is to give them to the {{weka.core.Instances}} class. At the command line type the following:
[[code format="bash"]]
 java weka.core.Instances filename.arff
[[code]]
where you substitute 'filename' for the actual name of your file. This should return an error if there is a problem reading the file, or show some statistics if the file is ok. The error message you get should give some indication of what is wrong.

== nominal value not declared in header, read Token[X], line Y ==
If you get this error message than you seem to have declared a nominal attribute in the ARFF header section, but Weka came across a value (**"X"**) in the data (in line **Y**) for this particular attribute that wasn't listed as possible value.
**All** nominal values that appear in the data must be declared in the header.
